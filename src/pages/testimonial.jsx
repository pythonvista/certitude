            This company has recently taken over my father’s care and “wow”
            these people are truly fantastic! Attention to detail has been
            great. What a breath of fresh air – professional, efficient,
            reliable. I could not have asked for better care for my father. Only
            wished he’d been assigned these people earlier – the previous care
            team should hang their heads because these people make them look
            like amateurs. Absolutely recommend – do not hesitate if you have
            the chance of getting them because their care standards are
            impressive.

            Just a note to thank you so much for the kind and dignified way you
            cared for Pat. You always had a smile for him and made him feel very
            comfortable in which was a very uncomfortable place for Pat to be.
            Pat really did think a lot of you. So thank you once again for
            caring for my lovely Pat.

            We had care provided by Reto Care for my mother through
            Hertfordshire CCG. The care was of an excellent standard and we
            would recommend this agency and in fact have recommended them to
            people. The care provided was of the highest standard and delivered
            with respect and compassion, the standard of care made a great
            difference to my mother’s last days the careers always bringing a
            smile to her face.
