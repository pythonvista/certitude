                Some people with long-term complex health needs qualify for free
                social care arranged and funded solely by the NHS. This is known
                as NHS continuing healthcare. People with terminal illnesses may
                also qualify.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reto care works closely with some local continuing health care
                teams to provide such care. Service users are referred to us
                from local hospitals and hospices and we provided care for them
                within the comfort of their homes.
              </p>
              <p>
                To find out if you qualify, speak to your local NHS CCG. <br />
                If you're eligible for NHS continuing healthcare, the next stage
                is to arrange a care and support package that meets your
                assessed needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Depending on your situation, different options could be
                suitable, including support in your own home and the option of a
                personal health budget.
